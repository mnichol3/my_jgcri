# CEDS Uncertainty Meeting - 31 Jan 2020

## Progress
* Various `TODO` tasks
* `mnichol3:Pshift` --> `JGCRI:uncertainty` PR
  * Believe failed output diff was caused by `config.R` being changed during `JGCRI:Pshift` --> `mnichol3:Pshift` merge, **not** a breaking change to the back-end code
    * Changes in commit [99345c392](https://github.com/mnichol3/CEDS-dev/commit/99345c3924271126714bf584b66993da8f99d3ca) indicate that the value of the `case_groups` variable in `config.R` was changed from `'bc_percent_change'` to `'bc_transport_scurve'` during the `JGCRI:Pshift` --> `mnichol3:Pshift` merge
      * The value of the `case_groups` variable in `config.R` was reverted in [5bc30913](https://github.com/mnichol3/CEDS-dev/commit/5bc309130bd28484ac382cc2db7d5acf647e0c76)
    * Since the name of the output file is hardcoded as `fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv` regardless of the actual case group being run, it is believed that results from the `bc_transport_scurve` case were unknowingly written to `fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv`.
    * The comparison between the improperly-named `fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv` output (resulting from running the `bc_transport_scurve` case) and the archived `fullEmissions-BC-Pshift-ACTUAL.csv` file failed because two different case groups were being compared. 

## Questions
* Is there a common style we're going to follow?
  * Function names, variable names, etc.
* Why does `/parameters/header.R` change the working directory to `input/`?
  * Is there an advantage over using relative paths anchored in the main `CEDS-dev/` dir?


## Issues

### driver.R
* **Line 148**:
  * Output file name is hard-coded as `fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv` regardless of what emission or fit is actually being run
  * Columns names are being appended to file, resulting in numerous warnings:
    ```
    13: In write.table(data.frame(x), "fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv",  ... :
      appending column names to file
    14: In write.table(data.frame(x), "fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv",  ... :
      appending column names to file
    ...
    ```


## Suggestions

* ### Renv
  Since CEDS is incredibly picky and depends on older package versions, it may be extrememly helpful to users during   installation & setup to include an [`renv` Reproducible Environment](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/renv/index.html), similar to what Alexey did in his [hector-rcmip](https://github.com/ashiklom/hector-rcmip) repo.
