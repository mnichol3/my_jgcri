# CEDS Uncertainty Meeting - 31 Jan 2020

## Progress

## Questions
* Is there a common style we're going to follow?
  * Function names, variable names, etc.
* Why does `/parameters/header.R` change the working directory to `input/`?
  * Is there an advantage over using relative paths?

## Issues

### driver.R
* **Line 148**:
  * Output file name is hard-coded as `fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv` regardless of what emission or fit is actually being run
  * Columns names are being appended to file, resulting in numerous warnings:
    ```
    13: In write.table(data.frame(x), "fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv",  ... :
      appending column names to file
    14: In write.table(data.frame(x), "fullEmissions-BC-Pshift.csv",  ... :
      appending column names to file
    ...
    ```
