## Weekly Hector Meeting - 23 Jan 2020

### 1. Updated Methane Radiative Forcing Equations
* Plot RCMIP RCP45 radiatiove forcings alongside default Hector & updated ([Etminan et al., 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL071930)) RFs
* Validate updated RFs
   * Using emissions from RCMIP SSP scenarios...
   * Calculate RFs using updated equations
   * Compare new RFs to default RCMIP Hector RFs
   
### 2. RCMIP
* Get running in parallel on pic
  * Clone repo fork
  * Install dependencies via `renv`
  * Install `hectortools`
    * Probably best to use [Alexey's fork](https://github.com/ashiklom/hectortools)
  * Build & install Hector `rcmip` branch as Hector R lib
  * ???
  * Profit

### 3. Open Hector Issues
* Halocarbons ([#325](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/issues/325) & [#329](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/issues/329))
* Gasses included in RCMIP that Hector doesn't currently track
