# Why is Hector So Cold?
![shrek is love, shrek is life](https://i.imgflip.com/2ymnsc.png)

## Tasks

### 1. Compare output of current 'default' Hector to RCMIP emissions

### 2. Compare output of current 'default' Hector to Hector v1.1 (pre-DOECLIM)
* Determine if the introduction of DOECLIM contributed to cold bias

### 3. Compare output from current default Hector, Hector v2.3, Hector v2.01, and RCMIP

### 4. Run current default Hector with default RCP emissions & RCMIP RCP emissions and compare
* Determine if the problem lies within Hector's default RCP files

### 5. Plot differences amongst key emissions between Hector versions and input emissions 
---

**Methods of comparison**: Plot emissions time series; inspect sizes of carbon pools (Land, ocean, detritus, etc.)

**Variables of interest**: CO2 concentration, temperature, total radiative forcing, key emissions
